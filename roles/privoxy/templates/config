#     see https://upribox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#customization

#
#  2.1. confdir
#  =============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The directory where the other configuration files are located.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Path name
#
#  Default value:
#
#      /etc/privoxy (Unix) or Privoxy installation dir (Windows)
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Mandatory
#
#  Notes:
#
#      No trailing "/", please.
#
confdir /etc/privoxy

#
#  2.2. templdir
#  ==============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      An alternative directory where the templates are loaded from.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Path name
#
#  Default value:
#
#      unset
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      The templates are assumed to be located in confdir/template.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Privoxy's original templates are usually overwritten with each
#      update. Use this option to relocate customized templates that
#      should be kept. As template variables might change between
#      updates, you shouldn't expect templates to work with Privoxy
#      releases other than the one they were part of, though.
#
templdir /etc/privoxy/custom_templates

#
#  2.3. logdir
#  ============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The directory where all logging takes place (i.e. where the
#      logfile is located).
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Path name
#
#  Default value:
#
#      /var/log/privoxy (Unix) or Privoxy installation dir (Windows)
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Mandatory
#
#  Notes:
#
#      No trailing "/", please.
#
logdir {{ default_settings.log.general.path }}/{{default_settings.log.privoxy.subdir}}

#
#  2.4. actionsfile
#  =================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The actions file(s) to use
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Complete file name, relative to confdir
#
#  Default values:
#
#        match-all.action # Actions that are applied to all sites and maybe overruled later on.
#
#        default.action   # Main actions file
#
#        user.action      # User customizations
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      No actions are taken at all. More or less neutral proxying.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Multiple actionsfile lines are permitted, and are in fact
#      recommended!
#
#      The default values are default.action, which is the "main"
#      actions file maintained by the developers, and user.action,
#      where you can make your personal additions.
#
#      Actions files contain all the per site and per URL
#      configuration for ad blocking, cookie management, privacy
#      considerations, etc. There is no point in using Privoxy
#      without at least one actions file.
#
#      Note that since Privoxy 3.0.7, the complete filename,
#      including the ".action" extension has to be specified. The
#      syntax change was necessary to be consistent with the other
#      file options and to allow previously forbidden characters.
#

actionsfile upri.block.action
actionsfile upri.css.action
actionsfile upri.ninja.action

#
#  2.5. filterfile
#  ================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The filter file(s) to use
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      File name, relative to confdir
#
#  Default value:
#
#      default.filter (Unix) or default.filter.txt (Windows)
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      No textual content filtering takes place, i.e. all +filter{name}
#      actions in the actions files are turned neutral.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Multiple filterfile lines are permitted.
#
#      The filter files contain content modification rules that use
#      regular expressions. These rules permit powerful changes on
#      the content of Web pages, and optionally the headers as well,
#      e.g., you could try to disable your favorite JavaScript
#      annoyances, re-write the actual displayed text, or just have
#      some fun playing buzzword bingo with web pages.
#
#      The +filter{name} actions rely on the relevant filter (name)
#      to be defined in a filter file!
#
#      A pre-defined filter file called default.filter that contains
#      a number of useful filters for common problems is included in
#      the distribution. See the section on the filter action for a
#      list.
#
#      It is recommended to place any locally adapted filters into a
#      separate file, such as user.filter.
#

filterfile upri.tagger.filter
filterfile upri.css.filter

#
#  2.6. logfile
#  =============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The log file to use
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      File name, relative to logdir
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset (commented out). When activated: logfile (Unix) or
#      privoxy.log (Windows).
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      No logfile is written.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      The logfile is where all logging and error messages are
#      written. The level of detail and number of messages are set
#      with the debug option (see below). The logfile can be useful
#      for tracking down a problem with Privoxy (e.g., it's not
#      blocking an ad you think it should block) and it can help you
#      to monitor what your browser is doing.
#
#      Depending on the debug options below, the logfile may be a
#      privacy risk if third parties can get access to it. As most
#      users will never look at it, Privoxy 3.0.7 and later only log
#      fatal errors by default.
#
#      For most troubleshooting purposes, you will have to change
#      that, please refer to the debugging section for details.
#
#      Your logfile will grow indefinitely, and you will probably
#      want to periodically remove it. On Unix systems, you can do
#      this with a cron job (see "man cron").
#
#      Any log files must be writable by whatever user Privoxy is
#      being run as (on Unix, default user id is "privoxy").
#
logfile {{ default_settings.log.privoxy.logfiles.logname }}

#
#  3. DEBUGGING
#  =============
#
#  These options are mainly useful when tracing a problem. Note that
#  you might also want to invoke Privoxy with the --no-daemon command
#  line option when debugging.
#
#
#  3.1. debug
#  ===========
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Key values that determine what information gets logged.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Integer values
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0 (i.e.: only fatal errors (that cause Privoxy to exit) are
#      logged)
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Default value is used (see above).
#
#  Notes:
#
#      The available debug levels are:
#
#        debug     1 # Log the destination for each request Privoxy let through. See also debug 1024.
#        debug     2 # show each connection status
#        debug     4 # show I/O status
#        debug     8 # show header parsing
#        debug    16 # log all data written to the network
#        debug    32 # debug force feature
#        debug    64 # debug regular expression filters
#        debug   128 # debug redirects
#        debug   256 # debug GIF de-animation
#        debug   512 # Common Log Format
#        debug  1024 # Log the destination for requests Privoxy didn't let through, and the reason why.
#        debug  2048 # CGI user interface
#        debug  4096 # Startup banner and warnings.
#        debug  8192 # Non-fatal errors
#        debug 32768 # log all data read from the network
#        debug 65536 # Log the applying actions
#
#      To select multiple debug levels, you can either add them or
#      use multiple debug lines.
#
#      A debug level of 1 is informative because it will show you
#      each request as it happens. 1, 1024, 4096 and 8192 are
#      recommended so that you will notice when things go wrong. The
#      other levels are probably only of interest if you are hunting
#      down a specific problem. They can produce a hell of an output
#      (especially 16).
#
#      Privoxy used to ship with the debug levels recommended above
#      enabled by default, but due to privacy concerns 3.0.7 and
#      later are configured to only log fatal errors.
#
#      If you are used to the more verbose settings, simply enable
#      the debug lines below again.
#
#      If you want to use pure CLF (Common Log Format), you should
#      set "debug 512" ONLY and not enable anything else.
#
#      Privoxy has a hard-coded limit for the length of log messages.
#      If it's reached, messages are logged truncated and marked with
#      "... [too long, truncated]".
#
#      Please don't file any support requests without trying to
#      reproduce the problem with increased debug level first. Once
#      you read the log messages, you may even be able to solve the
#      problem on your own.
#
debug     64
debug  1024 # Actions that are applied to all sites and maybe overruled later on.
debug  4096 # Startup banner and warnings
debug  8192 # Non-fatal errors

#
#  4. ACCESS CONTROL AND SECURITY
#  ===============================
#
#  This section of the config file controls the security-relevant
#  aspects of Privoxy's configuration.
#
#
#  4.1. listen-address
#  ====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The address and TCP port on which Privoxy will listen for
#      client requests.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      [IP-Address]:Port
#
#      [Hostname]:Port
#
#  Default value:
#
#      127.0.0.1:8118
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Bind to 127.0.0.1 (IPv4 localhost), port 8118. This is
#      suitable and recommended for home users who run Privoxy on the
#      same machine as their browser.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      You will need to configure your browser(s) to this proxy
#      address and port.
#
#      If you already have another service running on port 8118, or
#      if you want to serve requests from other machines (e.g. on
#      your local network) as well, you will need to override the
#      default.
#
#      You can use this statement multiple times to make Privoxy
#      listen on more ports or more IP addresses. Suitable if your
#      operating system does not support sharing IPv6 and IPv4
#      protocols on the same socket.
#
#      If a hostname is used instead of an IP address, Privoxy will
#      try to resolve it to an IP address and if there are multiple,
#      use the first one returned.
#
#      If the address for the hostname isn't already known on the
#      system (for example because it's in /etc/hostname), this may
#      result in DNS traffic.
#
#      If the specified address isn't available on the system, or if
#      the hostname can't be resolved, Privoxy will fail to start.
#
#      IPv6 addresses containing colons have to be quoted by
#      brackets. They can only be used if Privoxy has been compiled
#      with IPv6 support. If you aren't sure if your version supports
#      it, have a look at http://config.privoxy.org/show-status.
#
#      Some operating systems will prefer IPv6 to IPv4 addresses even
#      if the system has no IPv6 connectivity which is usually not
#      expected by the user. Some even rely on DNS to resolve
#      localhost which mean the "localhost" address used may not
#      actually be local.
#
#      It is therefore recommended to explicitly configure the
#      intended IP address instead of relying on the operating
#      system, unless there's a strong reason not to.
#
#      If you leave out the address, Privoxy will bind to all IPv4
#      interfaces (addresses) on your machine and may become
#      reachable from the Internet and/or the local network. Be aware
#      that some GNU/Linux distributions modify that behaviour
#      without updating the documentation. Check for non-standard
#      patches if your Privoxy version behaves differently.
#
#      If you configure Privoxy to be reachable from the network,
#      consider using access control lists (ACL's, see below), and/or
#      a firewall.
#
#      If you open Privoxy to untrusted users, you will also want to
#      make sure that the following actions are disabled:
#      enable-edit-actions and enable-remote-toggle
#
#  Example:
#
#      Suppose you are running Privoxy on a machine which has the
#      address 192.168.0.1 on your local private network
#      (192.168.0.0) and has another outside connection with a
#      different address. You want it to serve requests from inside
#      only:
#
#        listen-address  192.168.0.1:8118
#
#      Suppose you are running Privoxy on an IPv6-capable machine and
#      you want it to listen on the IPv6 address of the loopback
#      device:
#
#        listen-address [::1]:8118
#
listen-address  127.0.0.1:8118
listen-address  0.0.0.0:8120
# privoxy fails if trying to listen on same port on ipv6 and ipv4
listen-address [::1]:8119
listen-address [::]:8121

#
#  4.2. toggle
#  ============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Initial state of "toggle" status
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      1 or 0
#
#  Default value:
#
#      1
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Act as if toggled on
#
#  Notes:
#
#      If set to 0, Privoxy will start in "toggled off" mode, i.e.
#      mostly behave like a normal, content-neutral proxy with both
#      ad blocking and content filtering disabled. See
#      enable-remote-toggle below.
#
toggle  1

#
#  4.3. enable-remote-toggle
#  ==========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not the web-based toggle feature may be used
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      The web-based toggle feature is disabled.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      When toggled off, Privoxy mostly acts like a normal,
#      content-neutral proxy, i.e. doesn't block ads or filter
#      content.
#
#      Access to the toggle feature can not be controlled separately
#      by "ACLs" or HTTP authentication, so that everybody who can
#      access Privoxy (see "ACLs" and listen-address above) can
#      toggle it for all users. So this option is not recommended for
#      multi-user environments with untrusted users.
#
#      Note that malicious client side code (e.g Java) is also
#      capable of using this option.
#
#      As a lot of Privoxy users don't read documentation, this
#      feature is disabled by default.
#
#      Note that you must have compiled Privoxy with support for this
#      feature, otherwise this option has no effect.
#
enable-remote-toggle  0

#
#  4.4. enable-remote-http-toggle
#  ===============================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not Privoxy recognizes special HTTP headers to
#      change its behaviour.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#*
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Privoxy ignores special HTTP headers.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      When toggled on, the client can change Privoxy's behaviour by
#      setting special HTTP headers. Currently the only supported
#      special header is "X-Filter: No", to disable filtering for the
#      ongoing request, even if it is enabled in one of the action
#      files.
#
#      This feature is disabled by default. If you are using Privoxy
#      in a environment with trusted clients, you may enable this
#      feature at your discretion. Note that malicious client side
#      code (e.g Java) is also capable of using this feature.
#
#      This option will be removed in future releases as it has been
#      obsoleted by the more general header taggers.
#
enable-remote-http-toggle  0

#
#  4.5. enable-edit-actions
#  =========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not the web-based actions file editor may be used
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      The web-based actions file editor is disabled.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Access to the editor can not be controlled separately by
#      "ACLs" or HTTP authentication, so that everybody who can
#      access Privoxy (see "ACLs" and listen-address above) can
#      modify its configuration for all users.
#
#      This option is not recommended for environments with untrusted
#      users and as a lot of Privoxy users don't read documentation,
#      this feature is disabled by default.
#
#      Note that malicious client side code (e.g Java) is also
#      capable of using the actions editor and you shouldn't enable
#      this options unless you understand the consequences and are
#      sure your browser is configured correctly.
#
#      Note that you must have compiled Privoxy with support for this
#      feature, otherwise this option has no effect.
#
enable-edit-actions 0

#
#  4.6. enforce-blocks
#  ====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether the user is allowed to ignore blocks and can "go there
#      anyway".
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Blocks are not enforced.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Privoxy is mainly used to block and filter requests as a
#      service to the user, for example to block ads and other junk
#      that clogs the pipes. Privoxy's configuration isn't perfect
#      and sometimes innocent pages are blocked. In this situation it
#      makes sense to allow the user to enforce the request and have
#      Privoxy ignore the block.
#
#      In the default configuration Privoxy's "Blocked" page contains
#      a "go there anyway" link to adds a special string (the force
#      prefix) to the request URL. If that link is used, Privoxy will
#      detect the force prefix, remove it again and let the request
#      pass.
#
#      Of course Privoxy can also be used to enforce a network
#      policy. In that case the user obviously should not be able to
#      bypass any blocks, and that's what the "enforce-blocks" option
#      is for. If it's enabled, Privoxy hides the "go there anyway"
#      link. If the user adds the force prefix by hand, it will not
#      be accepted and the circumvention attempt is logged.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      enforce-blocks 1
#
enforce-blocks 0

#
#  4.7. ACLs: permit-access and deny-access
#  =========================================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Who can access what.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      src_addr[:port][/src_masklen] [dst_addr[:port][/dst_masklen]]
#
#      Where src_addr and dst_addr are IPv4 addresses in dotted
#      decimal notation or valid DNS names, port is a port number,
#      and src_masklen and dst_masklen are subnet masks in CIDR
#      notation, i.e. integer values from 2 to 30 representing the
#      length (in bits) of the network address. The masks and the
#      whole destination part are optional.
#
#      If your system implements RFC 3493, then src_addr and dst_addr
#      can be IPv6 addresses delimeted by brackets, port can be a
#      number or a service name, and src_masklen and dst_masklen can
#      be a number from 0 to 128.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#      If no port is specified, any port will match. If no
#      src_masklen or src_masklen is given, the complete IP address
#      has to match (i.e. 32 bits for IPv4 and 128 bits for IPv6).
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Don't restrict access further than implied by listen-address
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Access controls are included at the request of ISPs and
#      systems administrators, and are not usually needed by
#      individual users. For a typical home user, it will normally
#      suffice to ensure that Privoxy only listens on the localhost
#      (127.0.0.1) or internal (home) network address by means of the
#      listen-address option.
#
#      Please see the warnings in the FAQ that Privoxy is not
#      intended to be a substitute for a firewall or to encourage
#      anyone to defer addressing basic security weaknesses.
#
#      Multiple ACL lines are OK. If any ACLs are specified, Privoxy
#      only talks to IP addresses that match at least one
#      permit-access line and don't match any subsequent deny-access
#      line. In other words, the last match wins, with the default
#      being deny-access.
#
#      If Privoxy is using a forwarder (see forward below) for a
#      particular destination URL, the dst_addr that is examined is
#      the address of the forwarder and NOT the address of the
#      ultimate target. This is necessary because it may be
#      impossible for the local Privoxy to determine the IP address
#      of the ultimate target (that's often what gateways are used
#      for).
#
#      You should prefer using IP addresses over DNS names, because
#      the address lookups take time. All DNS names must resolve! You
#      can not use domain patterns like "*.org" or partial domain
#      names. If a DNS name resolves to multiple IP addresses, only
#      the first one is used.
#
#      Some systems allow IPv4 clients to connect to IPv6 server
#      sockets. Then the client's IPv4 address will be translated by
#      the system into IPv6 address space with special prefix
#      ::ffff:0:0/96 (so called IPv4 mapped IPv6 address). Privoxy
#      can handle it and maps such ACL addresses automatically.
#
#      Denying access to particular sites by ACL may have undesired
#      side effects if the site in question is hosted on a machine
#      which also hosts other sites (most sites are).
#
#  Examples:
#
#      Explicitly define the default behavior if no ACL and
#      listen-address are set: "localhost" is OK. The absence of a
#      dst_addr implies that all destination addresses are OK:
#
#        permit-access  localhost
#
#      Allow any host on the same class C subnet as www.privoxy.org

#        permit-access  www.privoxy.org/24 www.example.com/32
#
#      Allow access from any host on the 26-bit subnet 192.168.45.64
#      to anywhere, with the exception that 192.168.45.73 may not

#
#
#  4.8. buffer-limit
#  ==================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Maximum size of the buffer for content filtering.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Size in Kbytes
#
#  Default value:
#
#      4096
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Use a 4MB (4096 KB) limit.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      For content filtering, i.e. the +filter and +deanimate-gif
#      actions, it is necessary that Privoxy buffers the entire
#      document body. This can be potentially dangerous, since a
#      server could just keep sending data indefinitely and wait for
#      your RAM to exhaust -- with nasty consequences. Hence this
#      option.
#
#      When a document buffer size reaches the buffer-limit, it is
#      flushed to the client unfiltered and no further attempt to
#      filter the rest of the document is made. Remember that there
#      may be multiple threads running, which might require up to
#      buffer-limit Kbytes each, unless you have enabled
#      "single-threaded" above.
#
buffer-limit 4096


#  5.3. forwarded-connect-retries
#  ===============================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      How often Privoxy retries if a forwarded connection request
#      fails.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Number of retries.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Connections forwarded through other proxies are treated like
#      direct connections and no retry attempts are made.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      forwarded-connect-retries is mainly interesting for socks4a
#      connections, where Privoxy can't detect why the connections
#      failed. The connection might have failed because of a DNS
#      timeout in which case a retry makes sense, but it might also
#      have failed because the server doesn't exist or isn't
#      reachable. In this case the retry will just delay the
#      appearance of Privoxy's error message.
#
#      Note that in the context of this option, "forwarded
#      connections" includes all connections that Privoxy forwards
#      through other proxies. This option is not limited to the HTTP
#      CONNECT method.
#
#      Only use this option, if you are getting lots of
#      forwarding-related error messages that go away when you try
#      again manually. Start with a small value and check Privoxy's
#      logfile from time to time, to see how many retries are usually
#      needed.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      forwarded-connect-retries 1
#
forwarded-connect-retries  0

#
#  6. MISCELLANEOUS
#  =================
#
#  6.1. accept-intercepted-requests
#  =================================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether intercepted requests should be treated as valid.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Only proxy requests are accepted, intercepted requests are
#      treated as invalid.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      If you don't trust your clients and want to force them to use
#      Privoxy, enable this option and configure your packet filter
#      to redirect outgoing HTTP connections into Privoxy.
#
#      Make sure that Privoxy's own requests aren't redirected as
#      well. Additionally take care that Privoxy can't intentionally
#      connect to itself, otherwise you could run into redirection
#      loops if Privoxy's listening port is reachable by the outside
#      or an attacker has access to the pages you visit.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      accept-intercepted-requests 1
#
accept-intercepted-requests 1

#
#  6.2. allow-cgi-request-crunching
#  =================================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether requests to Privoxy's CGI pages can be blocked or
#      redirected.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Privoxy ignores block and redirect actions for its CGI pages.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      By default Privoxy ignores block or redirect actions for its
#      CGI pages. Intercepting these requests can be useful in
#      multi-user setups to implement fine-grained access control,
#      but it can also render the complete web interface useless and
#      make debugging problems painful if done without care.
#
#      Don't enable this option unless you're sure that you really
#      need it.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      allow-cgi-request-crunching 1
#
allow-cgi-request-crunching 0
#
#  6.3. split-large-forms
#  =======================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether the CGI interface should stay compatible with broken
#      HTTP clients.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      The CGI form generate long GET URLs.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Privoxy's CGI forms can lead to rather long URLs. This isn't a
#      problem as far as the HTTP standard is concerned, but it can
#      confuse clients with arbitrary URL length limitations.
#
#      Enabling split-large-forms causes Privoxy to divide big forms
#      into smaller ones to keep the URL length down. It makes
#      editing a lot less convenient and you can no longer submit all
#      changes at once, but at least it works around this browser
#      bug.
#
#      If you don't notice any editing problems, there is no reason
#      to enable this option, but if one of the submit buttons
#      appears to be broken, you should give it a try.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      split-large-forms 1
#
split-large-forms 0
#
#  6.4. keep-alive-timeout
#  ========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Number of seconds after which an open connection will no
#      longer be reused.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Time in seconds.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      None
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Connections are not kept alive.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      This option allows clients to keep the connection to Privoxy
#      alive. If the server supports it, Privoxy will keep the
#      connection to the server alive as well. Under certain
#      circumstances this may result in speed-ups.
#
#      By default, Privoxy will close the connection to the server if
#      the client connection gets closed, or if the specified timeout
#      has been reached without a new request coming in. This
#      behaviour can be changed with the connection-sharing option.
#
#      This option has no effect if Privoxy has been compiled without
#      keep-alive support.
#
#      Note that a timeout of five seconds as used in the default
#      configuration file significantly decreases the number of
#      connections that will be reused. The value is used because
#      some browsers limit the number of connections they open to a
#      single host and apply the same limit to proxies. This can
#      result in a single website "grabbing" all the connections the
#      browser allows, which means connections to other websites
#      can't be opened until the connections currently in use time
#      out.
#
#      Several users have reported this as a Privoxy bug, so the
#      default value has been reduced. Consider increasing it to 300
#      seconds or even more if you think your browser can handle it.
#      If your browser appears to be hanging, it probably can't.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      keep-alive-timeout 300
#
keep-alive-timeout 5

#
#  6.7. connection-sharing
#  ========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not outgoing connections that have been kept alive
#      should be shared between different incoming connections.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      None
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Connections are not shared.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      This option has no effect if Privoxy has been compiled without
#      keep-alive support, or if it's disabled.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Note that reusing connections doesn't necessary cause
#      speedups. There are also a few privacy implications you should
#      be aware of.
#
#      If this option is effective, outgoing connections are shared
#      between clients (if there are more than one) and closing the
#      browser that initiated the outgoing connection does no longer
#      affect the connection between Privoxy and the server unless
#      the client's request hasn't been completed yet.
#
#      If the outgoing connection is idle, it will not be closed
#      until either Privoxy's or the server's timeout is reached.
#      While it's open, the server knows that the system running
#      Privoxy is still there.
#
#      If there are more than one client (maybe even belonging to
#      multiple users), they will be able to reuse each others
#      connections. This is potentially dangerous in case of
#      authentication schemes like NTLM where only the connection is
#      authenticated, instead of requiring authentication for each
#      request.
#
#      If there is only a single client, and if said client can keep
#      connections alive on its own, enabling this option has next to
#      no effect. If the client doesn't support connection
#      keep-alive, enabling this option may make sense as it allows
#      Privoxy to keep outgoing connections alive even if the client
#      itself doesn't support it.
#
#      You should also be aware that enabling this option increases
#      the likelihood of getting the "No server or forwarder data"
#      error message, especially if you are using a slow connection
#      to the Internet.
#
#      This option should only be used by experienced users who
#      understand the risks and can weight them against the benefits.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      connection-sharing 1
#
connection-sharing 0

#
#  6.8. socket-timeout
#  ====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Number of seconds after which a socket times out if no data is
#      received.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Time in seconds.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      None
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      A default value of 300 seconds is used.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      The default is quite high and you probably want to reduce it.
#      If you aren't using an occasionally slow proxy like Tor,
#      reducing it to a few seconds should be fine.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      socket-timeout 300
#
socket-timeout 150

#
#  6.11. enable-compression
#  =========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not buffered content is compressed before delivery.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Privoxy does not compress buffered content.
#
#  Effect if set:
#
#      Privoxy compresses buffered content before delivering it to
#      the client, provided the client supports it.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      This directive is only supported if Privoxy has been compiled
#      with FEATURE_COMPRESSION, which should not to be confused with
#      FEATURE_ZLIB.
#
#      Compressing buffered content is mainly useful if Privoxy and
#      the client are running on different systems. If they are
#      running on the same system, enabling compression is likely to
#      slow things down. If you didn't measure otherwise, you should
#      assume that it does and keep this option disabled.
#
#      Privoxy will not compress buffered content below a certain
#      length.
#
#enable-compression 1

#
#  6.12. compression-level
#  ========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The compression level that is passed to the zlib library when
#      compressing buffered content.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Positive number ranging from 0 to 9.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      1
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Compressing the data more takes usually longer than
#      compressing it less or not compressing it at all. Which level
#      is best depends on the connection between Privoxy and the
#      client. If you can't be bothered to benchmark it for yourself,
#      you should stick with the default and keep compression
#      disabled.
#
#      If compression is disabled, the compression level is
#      irrelevant.
#
#  Examples:
#
#          # Best speed (compared to the other levels)
#          compression-level 1
#
#          # Best compression
#          compression-level 9
#
#          # No compression. Only useful for testing as the added header
#          # slightly increases the amount of data that has to be sent.
#          # If your benchmark shows that using this compression level
#          # is superior to using no compression at all, the benchmark
#          # is likely to be flawed.
#          compression-level 0
#
#
#compression-level 1
