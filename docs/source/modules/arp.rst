The upribox provides a zero-config service called *Apate* which allows you to benefit from the adblocking functionality
on every device in your network not just when connected to the upribox WiFi. This works with a technique called *ARP spoofing*.
In this role the Apate daemon files are copied and configured, requirements are installed to a virtual environment and eventually the daemon is (re)started.
