Silent Mode
***********

The Silent mode automatically blocks advertisement from websites and mobile
apps. In addition common tracking services are blocked as well.

What are trackers?
==================

No one likes annoying online advertisements. But this is just the tip of the iceberg
when it comes to negative side effects of your internet browsing. Much more harmful
and not directly visible to you websites include tools that gather your personal
information and use them across multiple websites: so called trackers.

... and why should we block them?
=================================

Trackers collect your private data and create a profile of you. This can include
sensitive data like your name, gender, age or sexual orientation. Apart from the
loss of sensitive information itself this can also be to your disadvantage when
websites use this profile to decline or adapt their offer to you based on gathered
information that my or may not be appropriate.

Ninja Mode

By activating Ninja mode the upribox will create another network (on Raspberry Pi 3 only with an additional WiFi dongle).
Connected devices benefit from the same ad- and tracker blocking mechanisms as in the Silent mode but additionally the traffic will be anonomized.

The upribox Ninja mode uses the Tor anonymity network to hinder tracking of
your Internet usage. For example, your internet provider will not be able to
see which websites you access. Your requests are tunneled through multiple
Tor relays which may cause reduction of your internet speed and websites being displayed in
foreign languages.

For the best protection of your anonymity we recommend the usage of the Tor Browser (download for
`Windows <https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html#windows>`__ or
`macOS <https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html#mac>`__) or alternatively
`Tails <https://tails.boum.org/>`__. If you can not use the Tor
Browser, activate and use the upribox Ninja mode.

You are on the move and want to access your E-mails or online banking
securely? Use the upribox VPN to protect your data when using public WiFi
hotspots.

VPN (virtual private network) makes it possible to surf with your upribox
while on the road. Access to your upribox is protected via VPN user
profiles. Create a VPN profile in the VPN section of the upribox user interface
and download it to your device (e.g. smart phone).

Usage of the upribox VPN requires the creation of VPN profiles and
installation of OpenVPN. For your smartphone, download the official OpenVPN
software for `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.openvpn.openvpn>`__
or `iOS <https://itunes.apple.com/at/app/openvpn-connect/id590379981?mt=8>`__.
For your desktop computer we recommend
`Tunnelblick for Mac OS <https://tunnelblick.net/>`__ or `OpenVPN GUI for Windows <https://openvpn.net/>`__.
